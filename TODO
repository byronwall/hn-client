Top Priorities:
    ☐ Server side should also maintain a single array of data
    ☐ Keep track of comment collapse state when returning to pages?
    ☐ Make the DataLayer a HOC or a comp that takes children - hopefully get better workflow for data steps
    ☐ Get rid of the bootstrap dependence and use the NavBar from Blueprint JS
    
Other options:
    ☐ Allow paging through days of results (or weeks or months)
        If doing this, figure out how to manage what data is stored where
    ☐ Keep track of read stories and filter them out?
    ☐ Ability to save stories for later?
