Top Priorities:
    ☐ Change out the client storage to a single array of stories and then lists of stories for each type
    ☐ Server side should also maintain a single array of data
    ☐ Allow the app to change the page title - `HN: ${title}`
    ☐ Add a loading indicator when fetching data
    ☐ Keep track of comment collapse state when returning to pages
    
Other options:
    ☐ Allow for grabbing more than 20 stories for the top lists (maybe do 30 by default?)
    ☐ Allow paging through days of results (or weeks or months)
        If doing this, figure out how to manage what data is stored where
    ☐ Keep track of read stories and filter them out?
    ☐ Ability to save stories for later?
    ☐ Link to send stories to pocket?
    ☐ Link to send comments page to Pocket (or HN app?)
