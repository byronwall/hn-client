An example I run into often is trying to find emails or texts about an event. I know the date that the event occurred but I might have said &quot;tomorrow&quot;, &quot;tuesday&quot;, &quot;the 25th&quot;, &quot;2020-08-25&quot; or &quot;yesterday&quot;. These all refer to the same date can could be indexed, however Now I need to search for all of these with different date restrictions to find the hits and not show the misses.",

I can&#x27;t think of good examples that I ran into, but some statistical methods have one name when physicists use it, another for biologists, another for statisticians, etc.<p>Could be interesting to compare the similarities of the semantics of the algorithms as understood by an NLP model. E.g. depth-first-search vs. monte-carlo, or dijkstra&#x27;s vs Kruskal&#x27;s. Both used in similar contexts, so you could group algorithms into families. I&#x27;d love to see more NLP-driven meta-analysis of scientific literature.",
